/**
 * A rigid body has various properties from the point of view of the
 * simulation. Some properties change over time:
 * <p>
 *  <li> Position vector (x,y,z) of the body's point of reference.
 *      Currently the point of reference must correspond to the body's center of mass.
 *  <li> Linear velocity of the point of reference, a vector (vx,vy,vz).
 *  <li> Orientation of a body, represented by a quaternion (qs,qx,qy,qz) or
 *      a 3x3 rotation matrix.
 *  <li> Angular velocity vector (wx,wy,wz) which describes how the orientation
 *      changes over time.
 * <p>
 * Other body properties are usually constant over time:
 * <p>
 *  <li> Mass of the body.
 *  <li> Position of the center of mass with respect to the point of reference.
 *      In the current implementation the center of mass and the point of
 *      reference must coincide.
 *  <li> Inertia matrix. This is a 3x3 matrix that describes how the body's mass
 *      is distributed around the center of mass. Conceptually each body has an
 *      x-y-z coordinate frame embedded in it that moves and rotates with the body.
 * <p>
 * The origin of this coordinate frame is the body's point of reference. Some values
 * in ODE (vectors, matrices etc) are relative to the body coordinate frame, and others
 * are relative to the global coordinate frame.
 * <p>
 * Note that the shape of a rigid body is not a dynamical property (except insofar as
 * it influences the various mass properties). It is only collision detection that cares
 * about the detailed shape of the body.
 * <p>
 * From odecpp.h.
